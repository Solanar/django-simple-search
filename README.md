# Simple Search
Django simple search app

Old code history can be found in https://github.com/AntycSolutions/utils

Inspired by [this blog post](http://julienphalip.com/post/2825034077/adding-search-to-a-django-site-in-a-snap) from eight years ago, as well as the many other "simple search" django apps out there.
